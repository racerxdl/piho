# LICENSE WARNING

Although all the code and schematics I did here is released under Apache / Creative Commons, the CAN2040 library is released under GPL. The creator of can2040 library doesn't seen to be willing to release it in another license (see https://github.com/KevinOConnor/can2040/issues/5 ) so basically since GPL is more restritive than the one I released, you should follow the GPL for this project.

So how that affects you? It will only affect you if you do distribute a binary version of the firmware. In this case GPL demands you to also release the source code. That's only likely to affect you if you're doing a commercial project and doesn't want to share the source code. Otherwise, you don't need to worry about it.

Although the can2040 library is GPL, everything else here will be as described in LICENSE. If anyone knows or want to do a replacement for can2040 library, let me know :D
